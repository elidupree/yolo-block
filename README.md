# yolo-block

Rust library providing `yolo!` blocks, which are like `try` blocks, except that they automatically unwrap the result. Effectively, inside a `yolo!` block, the `?` operator functions as `unwrap()`.

```rust
#![feature(try_blocks)]
use yolo_block::yolo;
use std::convert::TryFrom;

let result = yolo! {
    "1".parse::<usize>()?
        + usize::try_from(2i32)?
        + [0,1,2,3].binary_search(&3)?
};
assert_eq!(result, 6);

// Panics with the message "YOLO'd an error: ParseIntError { kind: InvalidDigit }"
let result = yolo! {
    "1".parse::<usize>()?
        + "foo".parse::<usize>()?
        + "3".parse::<usize>()?
};
```

## Motivation

This crate was primarily written as a joke, but I can imagine a practical use for it. While prototyping, you may want to write code that will ultimately handle errors using the `?` operator, but you may not yet have designed the way to catch the errors. In this case, wrapping the code in a `yolo!` block allows you write code that correctly uses `?`, rather than leaving `unwrap()` calls that you will need to replace later.

## Design and features

The `yolo!` macro uses a `try` block internally. `try` blocks are an unstable feature (as of this writing â€“ Rust 1.43.1), so this crate is only available on nightly, and you must enable `#![feature(try_blocks)]` in the crate where you use it.

`yolo-block` is fully compatible with `#![no_std]` (and `#![no_implicit_prelude]`).

A single `yolo!` block can handle multiple error types. Those error types can be any type that implements Debug. No extra type annotations are needed.

Internally, we use a custom error type that can be converted from anything that implements Debug. In order to handle disparate types without having to construct a `Box<dyn Debug>`, the `From` conversion simply panics immediately. The custom error type is actually uninhabited.
